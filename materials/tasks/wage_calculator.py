# Your friend suspects that his employer is shorting him on his paycheques,
# so he asks you to write a program to check how much he should be paid.

# You have some freedom to design how the pay system should work.

# You must:
#   - Take several inputs. Minimum: pay rate; time worked; one other factor.
#     Examples of other factors: holidays are 1.5x pay, overtime is extra,
#     restaurant workers get tips, ...
#   - For extra credit, consider pay for individual tasks, e.g.
#     number of pallets shipped or commission on house sales...
#   - Output a total amount he should expect on a paycheque for those inputs.
#   - Use at least one list. Specifically, the time worked should be in some
#     regular unit, such as a list of hours each day or days each month.
#     The user should enter numbers separated by spaces for you.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE (you do NOT need to use this structure)
# ==============================================================================

# Enter your hours worked this week: 8 7 6 8 0 5 7

# Enter your pay rate: 14.25

# Enter holidays (0 is regular day, 1 is holiday): 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

# Your pay is $200.75
