# Compare covid_sim_a.py and covid_sim_b.py.
# Similarly to what was done between those two versions,
# add two new features of your choice to the covid simulator.

# Some ideas (but you can have others):
# -- user input for all those constants? (Let the user choose different settings)
# -- masking?
# -- vaccination?
# -- super spreader events?
# -- age of a person?? (but how? perhaps a % chance itself...)
# -- more detailed reporting? (daily increase, % sick, anomalously high or low days...)
# -- recovery?
# -- death?
# -- avoiding infecting people
