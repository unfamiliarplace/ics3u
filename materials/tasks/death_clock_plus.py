# Take the death clock and add an if/elif/else block.
# You should have at least 2 questions that ONLY get asked if something else is true.
# (i.e. one answer leads to a different set of questions than the other answer.)
# For example, if you ask whether they play video games, and they say yes,
# only then would you bother asking how many times a week.
