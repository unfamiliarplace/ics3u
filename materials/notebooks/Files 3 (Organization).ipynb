However, because of the logical capabilities of Python, we can do much more than just command line tools.\n","\n","## Paths\n","\n","First, we should understand what a path is. A path is, loosely speaking, where something is on the drive. More specifically, it's a series of folder names separated by `'/'` or `'\\'` that may or may not terminate in a filename.\n","\n","Here are some examples of paths:\n","\n","```\n","C:/\n","C:/users/\n","C:/users/lsawczak/\n","C:/users/lsawczak/Desktop/\n","C:/users/lsawczak/Desktop/test.txt\n","```\n","\n","Paths in Python are rooted wherever the script is, so they don't need to start at the drive letters `C:/`.\n","\n","As we saw in the command line, we also have two special folder names:\n","\n","`.` refers to the current folder\n","\n","`..` refers to the parent of the current folder (e.g. `lsawczak` if we were in `Desktop`)\n","\n","Notice also that certain characters cannot be used in file or folder names in your operating system because they already are part of the structure of the path. This includes `:` and `/` and `\\`.\n","\n","## The `os` module\n","\n","The main module we use for file organization is `os`, which of course stands for `operating system`. The nice thing about Python is that it provides this \"interface\" between the operating system and Python code itself, meaning that you no longer need to worry about differences between Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. Python will figure out what to run on the underlying system based on the system it's running on.\n","\n","For most purposes, we just need a few things from `os`.\n","\n","After running each of the below, I recommend you refresh the folder listing at left to see the change.\n","\n","`os.mkdir(path)` creates a folder at the given location (root is where the script is)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"64-2qhgAVhri"},"source":["import os\n","os.mkdir('hey a new folder')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QfK1GHJuEh1l"},"source":["Run the above code block, then check the folder icon at left to see that it's there now.\n","\n","`os.path.exists(path)` returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the given location or file exists."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Gxpo7ndsEeow","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615996648739,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":502,"user":{"displayName":"Luke Sawczak","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhWDHDIVRpCFLq-JyUuuxJHu-cSHlrcrXBB8oEC4Q=s64","userId":"13231119776034628321"}},"outputId":"f1847b7e-f3e4-42fc-d6cf-81b57dbcb21f"},"source":["import os\n","\n","folder_name = 'my very own folder'\n","print('Checking if the folder exists)')\n","print(os.path.exists(folder_name))\n","\n","print('\\nMaking the folder')\n","os.mkdir(folder_name)\n","\n","print('\\nChecking if the folder exists')\n","print(os.path.exists(folder_name))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Checking if the folder exists)\n","False\n","\n","Making the folder\n","\n","Checking if the folder exists\n","True\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rBn1LRJuFd_-"},"source":["This is particularly useful when trying to write a file, because while Python will create a file when the filename doesn't exist, *it will not automatically create folders*."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KgUDy7CNFlP6"},"source":["import os\n","\n","folder_name_2 = 'no folder here'\n","filename = folder_name_2 + '/some_file.txt'\n","\n","# Before writing, check that the folder exists to avoid an error\n","if not os.path.exists(folder_name_2):\n","  os.mkdir(folder_name_2)\n","\n","f = open(filename, 'w')\n","f.write('Batman can beat Superman')\n","f.close()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oMw4IqWSEh8M"},"source":["`os.path.join(list)` returns a string with the parts of the path joined together.
