The simplest form is when it calls itself, but a more elaborate case would be A calls B calls C calls A.\n","\n","The purpose of recursion, and the answer to \"When would I use it?\", is that many problems can be broken into smaller versions of themselves. For example, in the pathfinding algorithm further down, finding a path from A -> B -> C -> D can be reduced to finding a path from B -> C -> D, which can be reduced to finding a path from C -> D.\n","\n","If that example seems similar to iteration, that's because it is — and many problems can be solved iteratively or recursively. But when the path becomes non-linear, it's difficult if not impossible to do with iteration. That's when recursion is most helpful."],"metadata":{"id":"41KahGh4epYt"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":["# Example recursive function (Fibonacci sequence)\r\n","\r\n","def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\r\n","  \"\"\"Return the nth Fibonacci number. 1-indexed.\"\"\"\r\n","\r\n","  if n == 1:\r\n","    return 0\r\n","  elif n == 2:\r\n","    return 1\r\n","  else:\r\n","    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\r\n","  \r\n","print(fibonacci(6))"],"outputs":[],"metadata":{"id":"7QLqs9haelrk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There are three things to know about recursion and your tasks will touch on all three.\n","\n","1. **Cases.** Every recursive function needs to define the different cases it can handle.

This means figuring out what output will be returned for a given input. There are two ways to do it: top-down (like the computer processes it) or bottom-up (more human). Whenever our trace involves a call whose output we know, we don't retrace, but substitute that output.\r\n","\r\n","For example, trace `fibonacci` for n = 1. We get 0. Trace `fibonacci` for n = 2. We get 1.\r\n","\r\n","| n | adding | f(n)\r\n","| -- | -- | --\r\n","| 1 | n/a | 0\r\n","| 2 | n/a | 1 \r\n"," \r\n","For n = 3, we add f(2) and f(1).

How do you know?\r\n","\r\n","3. **State.** Some recursive functions depend on a pre-existing state. The recursive calls then update the state. For example, if a recursive function takes a string argument, and during its execution it adds something to the string and then calls itself with the new string, the state has changed. This can be used to build up longer \"chains\" of data.\r\n","\r\n"," The initial state (e.g. `''`) can come from the outside scope, be seeded by the caller, be a default argument, or be created within the function and passed to a nested function."],"metadata":{"id":"l2XLdhF-BzUa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Tasks\n","\n","1. Write a recursive function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome. Remember to think about your cases, especially your base case! Verify / trace it with the following test cases: `''`, `'a'`, `'ba'`, `'bb'`, `'bad'`, `'bib'`, `'racecar'`.\n","\n","2. In the Recursion folder is `generate_maze.py`. It contains a function called `get_valid_paths`, which returns a set of all possible paths through a Path Through the Sands maze. Running the file will test the maze generation and pathfinding.\n","\n"," Trace and explain in a short sentence or two what happens in each of the following cases:\n"," * B and E are directly opposite, and there are no \"o\"s.\n"," * B and E are not directly opposite, and there are no \"o\"s.\n"," * B and E are directly opposite, and a single \"o\" is between them.\n"," * B and E are at right angles (e.g. east and north walls), and a single \"o\" connects them.\n"," * B and E are not directly opposite, and there is at least one \"o\", but it does not allow you to get to E.\n"," * B and E are not directly opposite, and are connected by several \"o\"s.\n"," * B and E are not directly opposite, and there are several \"o\"s that permit more than one route to get from B to E.\n"," \n"," For simplicity, you can skip the first block (the length limiter) if you like. It also serves as a kind of base case.\n","\n","3. Write a flatten dictionary function.\n","\n"," In a flatten dictionary function, you begin with a dictionary whose values may themselves be dictionaries. This is a recursive structure. You output a dictionary of depth 1, where each key points to the *terminal* value that it originally had.
