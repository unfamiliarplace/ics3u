It's a Google Drive file and is opened in Google Colaboratory.\n","\n","A notebook, in programming, is a recent invention that blends commentary and code. It's an interactive document that supports both blocks of text (like this one) and code snippets. Google Colab is fairly easy to use and has the benefit of Google Drive sharing options for collaboration.\n","\n","The blocks of text are written in a simple and very common language called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Double-click on this block to see what it looks like under the hood. Using a handful of symbols, it generates basic HTML like you see when you exit this block. For example, notice the correlation between `#` symbols and heading levels, and the symbols that are used to print *italic*, **bold**, or `in a monospace font`. We won't learn Markdown for the course, but it's well worth a few minutes of self-study if you're curious.\n","\n","The code snippets are mini-programs in Python. They run independently. For example, run this next block by hovering over it and clicking the `Play` button. (It may take a second to load; instead of running on your own computer like your Python scripts in Idle, it's requesting shared Google resources over the Internet.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Uluw-K990c0m"},"source":["name = input('Please enter your name: ')\n","print(f'Hello, {name}!')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DWWyBK-m06M8"},"source":["Notice that the output of the code is kept.
